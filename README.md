## 🚀 Project Overview

This project focuses on designing and deploying a **robust, scalable cloud architecture** on AWS using **Terraform** for Infrastructure as Code (IaC). It combines cloud architecture planning with automation to provision and manage essential AWS resources.

The goal is to create a cloud environment that mirrors a detailed architecture plan — including EC2 instances, S3 buckets, RDS databases, security groups, IAM roles, and Elastic Load Balancers — fully automated through Terraform.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Design a comprehensive cloud architecture plan showing component connections and data flow
- Implement and automate the architecture using Terraform configurations
- Master key Terraform commands to initialize, plan, and apply infrastructure changes
- Demonstrate ability to manage infrastructure as code with version control

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Terraform** for Infrastructure as Code automation
- **AWS Services:** EC2, S3, RDS, Security Groups, IAM, Elastic Load Balancer
- **Git** for version control of Terraform configurations

---

## ✅ Outcome

- Hands-on experience designing cloud architecture with scalable AWS components
- Proficiency in automating infrastructure deployment with Terraform
- Understanding of how to manage infrastructure lifecycle via IaC and Git
- Ability to create a cloud environment that matches planned architecture efficiently
