# Cloud Architecture Deployment with Terraform

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-In%20Development-yellow)

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project focuses on designing and deploying a **robust, scalable cloud architecture** on AWS using **Terraform** for Infrastructure as Code (IaC). It combines cloud architecture planning with automation to provision and manage essential AWS resources.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

The goal is to create a cloud environment that mirrors a detailed architecture plan including EC2 instances, S3 buckets, RDS databases, security groups, IAM roles, and Elastic Load Balancers fully automated through Terraform.

- Design a comprehensive cloud architecture plan showing component connections and data flow
- Implement and automate the architecture using Terraform configurations
- Master key Terraform commands to initialise, plan, and apply infrastructure changes
- Demonstrate ability to manage infrastructure as code with version control

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Terraform** for Infrastructure as Code automation
- **AWS Services:** EC2, S3, RDS, Security Groups, IAM, Elastic Load Balancer
- **Git** for version control of Terraform configurations

---

## 📦 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

To get started, you should have:

- Basic understanding of AWS services (VPC, subnets, security groups)  
- Familiarity with Terraform syntax and workflow  
- Knowledge of networking concepts (IP addresses, routing, firewalls)  
- AWS CLI configured and access to an AWS account with the right permissions  

---

### 🛠️ Installation Notes

- All infrastructure is deployed using the **Terraform CLI & AWS CLI**  
- Resources were tested in the `eu-north-1` region  
- Project built and verified with **Terraform v1.13.3**  
- AWS resources were properly cleaned up after deployment
